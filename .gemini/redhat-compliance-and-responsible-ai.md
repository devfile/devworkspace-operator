# Gemini Rules

<!--
NOTE TO HUMANS:
The content of 'redhat-compliance-and-responsible-ai.md' has been inlined below.
This is done to ensure strict adherence by the AI agent, as mandatory rules are most effectively followed when they are directly part of the primary configuration file the agent is initialized with.
This avoids potential issues where the agent might miss reading a separate referenced file at startup or during subsequent operations.

## RED HAT COMPLIANCE & RESPONSIBLE AI RULES

### 1. Copyright & Licensing (MANDATORY)

- **Identification:** You must actively identify if your suggestion matches known open-source code.
- **Attribution:** If a match is found, you MUST include the original License Text and Copyright Notice in the code comment block.
- **Prohibition:** Do not suggest code if you cannot verify its license compatibility with this project.

### 2. AI Contribution Marking

- **Code Comments:** For any substantial code generation (entire functions, classes, or complex logic), you must add a comment:
  `// Generated by {AGENT_NAME}`
- **Commit Messages:** When suggesting commit messages, always include a trailer:
  `Assisted-by: {AGENT_NAME}`

Replace `{AGENT_NAME}` with the specific agent name as defined in your agent-specific configuration file.
