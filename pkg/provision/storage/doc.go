// Package storage contains library functions for provisioning volumes and volumeMounts in containers according to the
// volume components in a devfile. These functions also handle mounting project sources to containers that require it.
//
// TODO:
// - Figure out how to handle 'size' parameter on volumes, given that we can't meaningfully use it for
//   common PVC-type storage
// - Devfile API spec is unclear on how mountSources should be handled -- mountPath is assumed to be /projects
//   and volume name is assumed to be "projects"
//   see issues:
//     - https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/290
//     - https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/291
