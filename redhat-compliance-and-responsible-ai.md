- **Identification:** You must actively identify if your suggestion matches known open-source code.
- **Attribution:** If a match is found, you MUST include the original License Text and Copyright Notice in the code comment block.
- **Prohibition:** Do not suggest code if you cannot verify its license compatibility with this project.

## 2. AI Contribution Marking

- **Code Comments:** For any substantial code generation (entire functions, classes, or complex logic), you must add a comment:
  `// Generated by {AGENT_NAME}`
