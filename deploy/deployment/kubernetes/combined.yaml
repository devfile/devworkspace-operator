                                    dataSourceRef:
                                      description: 'dataSourceRef specifies the object
                                        from which to populate the volume with data,
                                        if a non-empty volume is desired. This may
                                        be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding
                                        will only succeed if the type of the specified
                                        object matches some installed volume populator
                                        or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace
                                        the functionality of the dataSource field
                                        and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                        they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                        in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                        and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty
                                        and the other is non-empty. When namespace
                                        is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                        isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between
                                        dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                                        only allows two specific types of objects,
                                        dataSourceRef   allows any non-core object,
                                        as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                        (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is   specified. * While dataSource only
                                        allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                        objects   in any namespaces. (Beta) Using

                                        the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires
